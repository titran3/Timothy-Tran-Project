                <h2 class="cool">Compared to schools in higher-income neighborhoods, low-income schools have less opportunities. High levels of science, math, and advanced placement courses are less accessible to students in high poverty schools, and state and  spending on teachers and educational resources is lower. In the 2013–2014 academic year, the average teacher compensation in high poverty schools was around $46,000 as opposed to approximately $57,000 in low poverty schools.</h2>
